        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an introvert with social anxiety. I am not very shy but I don't like talking to people. 
            I avoid phone calls. I don't go outside, I love reading, watching YouTube videos and learning 
            new things. I avoid all social occasion and interaction. I hate small talks but I love meaningful 
            talks. Sometimes I get irritated because we should go outside and interact with people. And people 
            will think you are a stupid if you socially awkward.</p>
        <p>Moreover, I would describe myself as a quiet person but very talkative inside my head. A thousands of 
            things are running in my mind while staying quiet. Even while talking, analyzing and thinking 
            with my own algorithms. I prefer to do work alone and by myself. I would say that I'm self aware 
            and know what will make me happy on a long term. Most of my decisions are good, and few were not, 
            but I learn from them. Not forcing someone to stay, rather enjoys my own company and finding some 
            of the goods in every bad.</p>
